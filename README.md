1) Download + unpack or clone  
2) Place folder "a773_er301_bespoke" inside of "ER-301/libs/" on your SD-card

## Regarding CPU-usage
CPU-usage is not linear on the ER-301. These figures are measured in the most conservative way:  
1) Measured on around 60-70% cpu load, by loading a large number of units  
2) Cpu usage = (total_cpu% - 3%) / nb_units  
3) CU is the cpu usage from a comparable custom unit build by me
