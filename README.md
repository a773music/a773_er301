## Regarding CPU-usage
CPU-usage is not linear on the ER-301. These figures are measured in the most conservative way:  
- Measured on around 60-70% cpu load, by loading a large number of units  
- Cpu usage = (total_cpu% - 3%) / nb_units  
- CU refers to the cpu usage of a comparable custom unit build by me
